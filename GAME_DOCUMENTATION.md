# CkribbleLabs - Multiplayer Drawing & Guessing Game

## 1. Brief Description

CkribbleLabs is a real-time multiplayer drawing and guessing game inspired by popular games like Pictionary and Skribbl.io. Players take turns drawing words while others try to guess what's being drawn. The game features interactive canvas drawing, real-time chat, scoring systems, and both individual and team-based gameplay modes.

The application provides an engaging social gaming experience where players can create or join rooms, select from themed word categories, customize their avatars, and compete in multiple rounds of creative drawing and quick thinking.

### Core Mechanics
- **Turn-Based Drawing**: Players rotate as the "drawer" who must illustrate a selected word
- **Real-Time Guessing**: Other players submit guesses through a live chat system
- **Word Selection**: Drawers choose from 3 randomly generated word options

2. **Avatar & Display Name**: Players select avatars and set display names
3. **Game Configuration**: Host configures number of rounds, drawing time, themes, and game mode
4. **Drawing Phase**: Current drawer selects a word and illustrates it on the canvas
5. **Guessing Phase**: Other players submit guesses via chat in real-time
6. **Scoring**: Points awarded for correct guesses and successful drawings
